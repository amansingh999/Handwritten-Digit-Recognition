# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

This project recognizing the handwritten digits (0 to 9) from the famous MNIST dataset.
Digit recognition system is the working of a machine to train itself or recognizing the digits from different sources like 
emails, bank cheque, papers, images, etc. and in different real-world scenarios for online handwriting recognition on computer tablets or system, 
recognize number plates of vehicles, processing bank cheque amounts, numeric entries in forms filled up by hand (say â€” tax forms) and so on..
The handwritten digits are not always of the same size, width, orientation and justified to margins as they differ from writing of person to person, 
so the general problem would be while classifying the digits due to the similarity between digits such as 1 and 7, 5 and 6, 3 and 8, 2 and 5, 2 and 7, etc. 
This problem is faced more when many people write a single digit with a variety of different handwritings.
